</div>

1. ** What is biohacking, augmenting, grinding, etc? **

    - AUGMENTING: To enhance or amplify something by adding to it, or in this context, to modify or improve the human body.

    - BIOHACKING: The unconventional or subversive application of technology to enhance or alter the human body's structure or capibilities.

    - GRINDING: A subset of biohacking that focuses on more radical and customized implants, augmentations, and modifications.

2. How is this different than DIY-Bio, Citizen Science, Nootropics, Transhumanism, etc.?

    - DIY-BIO: Scientific research in biology undertaken by individuals outside the traditional setting of academic or research institutions, utilizing home labs with methods comparable to those in research facilities.

    - CITIZEN SCIENCE: Scientific research conducted by non-professionals outside the traditional setting of academic or research institutions.

    - NOOTROPICS: Commonly known as "smart drugs" or "cognitive enhancers," these synthetic and natural compounds are purported to enhance cognitive function.

    - TRANSHUMANISM: A philosophical movement that promotes the use of technology to augment human existence as a way to improve individual abilities, life quality, and to mitigate disease and suffering.

14. What are the risks from a medical perspective?

    - Early animal studies suggested an increased risk of cancerous tumors developing near implants, but the detail most often left out is that cancer was being induced and accelerated in these studies. There's very little real medical risk.

15. Are there any cases of infection or an allergic reaction?

    - Infection, allergic reaction, or rejection are rare and typically the result of poor aftercare or subpar DIY coatings. There are few recent cases with x-series bioglass microchip implants, which are among the most common.

16. What about medical imaging?

    - Medical imaging is a non-issue except for implanted magnets. Dangerous Things provides an MRI compatibility guide for glass microchips, and a few individuals have undergone MRIs with magnets, although this isn't recommended.
