# AUGMENTER’S BIOHACKING FAQ

</div>

<details><summary>

### 1. What is biohacking, augmenting, grinding, etc?

</summary>

 - For the purposes of this guide, biohacking refers to the use of implanted technologies such as NFC/RFID microchips, sensory magnets, LEDs, and similar enhancements.

- **AUGMENTING**: To enhance or amplify something by adding to it, or in this context, to modify or improve the human body.

- **BIOHACKING**: The unconventional or subversive application of technology to enhance or alter the human body's structure or capabilities. A portmanteau of BIO and HACKING.

- **GRINDING**: A subset of biohacking that focuses on more radical and customized implants, augmentations, and modifications.

### 2. How is this different than DIY-Bio, Citizen Science, Nootropics, Transhumanism, etc?

</summary>

- This guide defines biohacking as the integration of implanted technologies, focusing on physical augmentation rather than biological experimentation or philosophical ideologies. It differs from DIY-BIO, citizen science, nootropics, and transhumanism by emphasizing practical, accessible enhancements to the body using technology.

- **DIY-BIO**: Scientific research in biology undertaken by individuals outside the traditional setting of academic or research institutions, utilizing home labs with methods comparable to those in research facilities.

- **CITIZEN SCIENCE**: Scientific research conducted by non-professionals outside the traditional setting of academic or research institutions.

- **NOOTROPICS**: Commonly known as "smart drugs" or "cognitive enhancers," these synthetic and natural compounds are purported to enhance cognitive function.

- **TRANSHUMANISM**: A philosophical movement that promotes the use of technology to augment human existence as a way to improve individual abilities, life quality, and to mitigate disease and suffering.

### 3. How is this different than Bryan Johnson or Andrew Huberman?

</summary>

 - Unlike Bryan Johnson’s focus on longevity through biomedical intervention or Andrew Huberman’s emphasis on optimizing brain and body function through evidence-based practices, this guide’s centers on integrating implanted technologies. It prioritizes practical, hands-on augmentations over biological optimization or health monitoring.

### 4. What is an implant?

</summary>

 - In this context, an implant refers to embedded devices like [NFC/RFID microchips](https://dangerousthings.com/product/next/), [flexible implants](https://dangerousthings.com/product/apex-flex/), [magnets](https://dangerousthings.com/product/xg3/), [LEDs](https://dangerousthings.com/product/xsiid/), and similar technologies.

 - **IMPLANT**: Inert material or object embedded within the body.

### 5. Am I a cyborg?

</summary>

- Do you feel like a cyborg? This question delves into personal identity and opinion, and there's been extensive discussion on the topic. Check-out some of the following readings:

- **CYBORG**: A person whose physiological abilities are extended beyond normal limitations by human-machine systems. A portmanteau of CYBERNETIC and ORGANISM.

- [COMMON CYBORG:](https://granta.com/common-cyborg/) The experiences of a woman who considers herself a cyborg due to her use of prosthetics. Explore the complexities of living with a technological limb, societal perceptions, and the exclusion of disabled perspectives in discussions on cyborg identities.

- [CYBORG MANIFESTO: SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, AND SOCIALIST-FEMINISM IN THE LATE TWENTIETH CENTURY:](https://doi.org/10.5749/minnesota/9780816650477.003.0001) 1980s American socialist feminism through the lens of C3I (command-control-communications-intelligence) systems, exploring the amalgamation of sciences and natural-social realms within this framework.

- [CYBORGS, AGENTS, AND TRANSHUMANISTS CROSSING TRADITIONAL BORDERS OF BODY AND IDENTITY IN THE CONTEXT OF NEW TECHNOLOGY:](http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/002409400552838) Delves into the significance of the body's continuous interaction with the world, suggesting that attempts to alter or control the body through technology stem from a desire to manage the unpredictable and unconscious aspects of human life.

- [CYBORGS AND SPACE:](https://web.mit.edu/digitalapollo/Documents/Chapter1/cyborgs.pdf) Examines the transition towards integrating humans with machines, or "cyborgs," to adapt to space environments, detailing technological and biological modifications necessary for survival in extraterrestrial conditions. 

- [CYBORG MORALS, CYBORG VALUES, CYBORG ETHICS:](http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:ETIN.0000006870.65865.cf) Discusses the state and ethical implications of the emerging era of cyborgs, exploring pathways to becoming a cyborg, various types, and the author's personal experimentation, highlighting the importance of addressing ethical issues as advancements impact human and cyborg relations.

- [CYBORG PEDAGOGY PERFORMING RESISTANCE IN THE DIGITAL AGE:](https://doi.org/10.2307/1321078) Posits the cyborg as a metaphor for critiquing the influence of information technology on posthuman identity and bodies, through the examination of performance artists like Stelarc and Orlan, introducing "cyborg pedagogies" as a means to explore digital culture's impact.

- [HEAVENLY BODIES: WHY IT MATTERS THAT CYBORGS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN ABOUT DISABILITY, MENTAL HEALTH, AND MARGINALIZATION:](https://afutureworththinkingabout.com/?p=5396) The importance of inclusivity, adaptability, and honoring lived experiences in shaping future understandings of the cyborg and human existence.

- [I, CYBORG:](https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/0252072154) The journey of Kevin Warwick, a trailblazer in the field of cybernetics, who has taken extraordinary steps to become part human, part machine.

- [LAW AND POLICY IN AN ERA OF CYBORG-ASSISTED-LIFE THE IMPLICATIONS OF INTERFACING IN-THE-BODY TECHNOLOGIES TO THE OUTER WORLD:](https://doi.org/10.1109/ISTAS.2013.6613121) Advancements in medical technology are poised to integrate high-performance computational processors and synthetic DNA with human anatomy, promising to extend lifespans, enhance intellect, and introduce smart nano-prosthetics, but also raising critical ethical questions about accessibility, security, and the very definition of "human" in a future dominated by human cyborgs.

- [NATURAL-BORN CYBORGS MINDS, TECHNOLOGIES, AND THE FUTURE OF HUMAN INTELLIGENCE:](https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/0195177517) Challenges the  depiction of cyborgs in popular culture, arguing that humans are inherently cyborg-like due to our natural ability to integrate tools and technologies into our existence.

### 6. What type of implants are there?

</summary>

- Implants come in a wide variety of forms, including:

- [Microchips](https://dangerousthings.com/product/next/)
- [Flexible](https://dangerousthings.com/product/apex-flex/)
- [Magnets](https://dangerousthings.com/product/xg3/)

</details>

<details><summary>

### 7. Why are transdermal implants suboptimal?

</summary>

 - Transdermal implants, which reside both above and beneath the skin, are generally considered suboptimal due to their increased risk of infection and rejection.

</details>

<details><summary>

### 8. How can implants be used?

</summary>

- Implants can be used in a wide variety of ways, including: 

- Visual
- Auditory
- Tactile
- NFC/RFID Identification
- Payment
- Illumination
- Data Storage
- Sensory Perception

</details>

<details><summary>

### 9. Are there payment implants?

</summary>

 - Yes, payment implants do exist, but they have yet to become mainstream due to limitations imposed by the financial and credit industries. One example of a payment implant is the [Walletmor](https://cyborg.ksecsolutions.com/product/walletmor-installation-apex-needle/).

</details>

<details><summary>

### 10. Can I be GPS tracked?

</summary>

- The short answer is no.

- The long answer is no because RFID/NFC and GPS tracking, is 'Active RFID location tracking integrated with a GPS tracking system'. This differs from simple RFID/NFC identification, which is passively powered and remains inactive the majority of the time. Consider pet microchips: if your dog is lost, someone must take it to a veterinarian to have the microchip scanned. There's no way to GPS locate a lost animal solely from it's microchip.

</details>

<details><summary>

### 15. Are there any cases of infection or an allergic reaction?

</summary>

- Infection, allergic reaction, or rejection are rare and typically the result of poor aftercare or subpar DIY coatings. There are few recent cases with x-series bioglass microchip implants, which are among the most common.

</details>

<details><summary>

### 16. What about medical imaging?

</summary>

- Medical imaging is a non-issue except for implanted magnets. Dangerous Things provides an MRI compatibility guide for glass microchips, and a few individuals have undergone MRIs with magnets, although this isn't recommended.
