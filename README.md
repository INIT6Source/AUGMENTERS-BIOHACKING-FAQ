# AUGMENTER’S BIOHACKING FAQ

</div>

<details><summary>

### 1. What is biohacking, augmenting, grinding, etc?

</summary>

 For the purposes of this guide, biohacking refers to the use of implanted technologies such as NFC/RFID microchips, sensory magnets, LEDs, and similar enhancements.

- **AUGMENTING**: To enhance or amplify something by adding to it, or in this context, to modify or improve the human body.

- **BIOHACKING**: The unconventional or subversive application of technology to enhance or alter the human body's structure or capabilities. A portmanteau of BIO and HACKING.

- **GRINDING**: A subset of biohacking that focuses on more radical and customized implants, augmentations, and modifications.

### 2. How is this different than DIY-Bio, Citizen Science, Nootropics, Transhumanism, etc?

</summary>

This guide defines biohacking as the integration of implanted technologies, focusing on physical augmentation rather than biological experimentation or philosophical ideologies. It differs from DIY-BIO, citizen science, nootropics, and transhumanism by emphasizing practical, accessible enhancements to the body using technology.

- **DIY-BIO**: Scientific research in biology undertaken by individuals outside the traditional setting of academic or research institutions, utilizing home labs with methods comparable to those in research facilities.

- **CITIZEN SCIENCE**: Scientific research conducted by non-professionals outside the traditional setting of academic or research institutions.

- **NOOTROPICS**: Commonly known as "smart drugs" or "cognitive enhancers," these synthetic and natural compounds are purported to enhance cognitive function.

- **TRANSHUMANISM**: A philosophical movement that promotes the use of technology to augment human existence as a way to improve individual abilities, life quality, and to mitigate disease and suffering.

### 3. How is this different than Bryan Johnson or Andrew Huberman?

</summary>

 Unlike Bryan Johnson’s focus on longevity through biomedical intervention or Andrew Huberman’s emphasis on optimizing brain and body function through evidence-based practices, this guide’s centers on integrating implanted technologies. It prioritizes practical, hands-on augmentations over biological optimization or health monitoring.

### 6. What type of implants are there?

</summary>

Implants come in a wide variety of forms, including:

- [Microchips](https://dangerousthings.com/product/next/)
- [Flexible](https://dangerousthings.com/product/apex-flex/)
- [Magnets](https://dangerousthings.com/product/xg3/)

</details>

<details><summary>

### 7. Why are transdermal implants suboptimal?

</summary>

Transdermal implants, which reside both above and beneath the skin, are generally considered suboptimal due to their increased risk of infection and rejection.

</details>

<details><summary>

### 8. How can implants be used?

</summary>

Implants can be used in a wide variety of ways, including: 

- Visual
- Auditory
- Tactile
- NFC/RFID Identification
- Payment
- Illumination
- Data Storage
- Sensory Perception

</details>

<details><summary>

### 9. Are there payment implants?

</summary>

Yes, payment implants do exist, but they have yet to become mainstream due to limitations imposed by the financial and credit industries. One example of a payment implant is the [Walletmor](https://cyborg.ksecsolutions.com/product/walletmor-installation-apex-needle/).

</details>

<details><summary>

### 10. Can I be GPS tracked?

</summary>

The short answer is no.

The long answer is no because RFID/NFC and GPS tracking, is 'Active RFID location tracking integrated with a GPS tracking system'. This differs from simple RFID/NFC identification, which is passively powered and remains inactive the majority of the time. Consider pet microchips: if your dog is lost, someone must take it to a veterinarian to have the microchip scanned. There's no way to GPS locate a lost animal solely from it's microchip.

<details><summary>

### 11. What if I've been implanted against my will?

</summary>

If you suspect that you have been implanted against your will, I highly recommend reading the following forum thread: https://forum.dangerousthings.com/t/so-you-think-youve-been-implanted-against-your-will/64

</details>

<details><summary>

### 12. Are implants safe?

</summary>

Implants are generally regarded as safe, comparable to other body modifications like tattoos or piercings, though they carry similar inherent risks, including rejection, infection, or allergic reactions.

</details>

<details><summary>

### 13. Are implants FDA approved?

</summary>

The majority of implants lack FDA approval, but that doesn’t mean efforts aren’t underway to obtain it as is the case for the [VivoKey Spark 2](https://dangerousthings.com/product/vivokey-spark/).

</details>

<details><summary>

### 14. What are the risks from a medical perspective?

</summary>

Early animal studies suggested an increased risk of cancerous tumors developing near implants, but the detail most often left out is that cancer was being induced and accelerated in these studies. There's very little real medical risk.

</details>

<details><summary>

### 15. Are there any cases of infection or an allergic reaction?

</summary>

Infection, allergic reaction, or rejection are rare and typically the result of poor aftercare or subpar DIY coatings. There are few recent cases with x-series bioglass microchip implants, which are among the most common.

</details>

<details><summary>

### 16. What about medical imaging?

</summary>

Medical imaging is a non-issue except for implanted magnets. Dangerous Things provides an MRI compatibility guide for glass microchips, and a few individuals have undergone MRIs with magnets, although this isn't recommended.
