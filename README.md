## 7. Why are transdermal implants suboptimal?

</summary>

Transdermal implants, which reside both above and beneath the skin, are generally considered suboptimal due to their increased risk of infection and rejection.

</details>

<details><summary>

## 8. How can implants be used?

</summary>

Implanted technology offers a wide range of applications, from restoring and enhancing human senses to providing digital identification and data storage. Here are some of the most common applications.

### Visual

Visual implants are designed to enhance or restore vision by interfacing with the visual system. This technology aims to assist individuals with vision impairments or augment the natural capabilities. Examples include infrared eye drops and Neil Harbisson's "Cyborg Antenna."

### Auditory

Auditory implants aim to restore or enhance hearing by stimulating the auditory pathways. These devices assist individuals with hearing loss or augment auditory perception beyond natural capabilities. Examples include tragus magnets. 

### Tactile

Tactile implants enhance or restore the sense of touch by interfacing with the nervous system. These devices can aid individuals with sensory impairments or augment tactile perception for enhanced interaction with the environment. Examples include implanted sensory magnets.

### NFC/RFID Identification 

NFC (Near Field Communication) and RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) implants serve as digital identification tools. They enable wireless communication with compatible devices for authentication, access control, and information storage. Examples include the Dangerous Things NeXT and xEM.

### Payment

Payment implants facilitate electronic transactions by storing payment information. They enable users to make purchases without traditional payment methods like credit cards or smartphones. Examples include the [Walletmor](https://web.archive.org/web/20230528032836/https://cyborg.ksecsolutions.com/product/walletmor-installation-apex-needle/).

### Illumination

Illumination implants incorporate light-emitting components into the body, providing aesthetic enhancements for decorative purposes. Examples include the Dangerous Things xSIID and xLED.

</details>

<details><summary>

## 9. Can I be GPS tracked?

</summary>

The short answer is no.

The long answer is no because RFID/NFC with GPS tracking, is 'Active RFID location tracking integrated with a GPS tracking system'. This differs from simple RFID/NFC identification, which is passively powered and remains inactive the majority of the time. Consider pet microchips: If your dog is lost, someone must take it to a veterinarian to have the microchip scanned. There's no way to GPS locate a lost animal solely from it's microchip. 

</details>

<details><summary>

## 10. What if I've been implanted against my will?

</summary>

If you suspect that you have been implanted against your will, reading the following forum thread is highly recommend: [So You Think You've Been Implanted Against Your Will](https://web.archive.org/web/20240228112814/https://forum.dangerousthings.com/t/so-you-think-youve-been-implanted-against-your-will/64)

</details>

<details><summary>

## 11. Are implants safe?

</summary>

Implants are generally considered safe, comparable to other body modifications like tattoos or piercings, though they carry similar risks, including rejection, infection, or allergic reactions.

</details>

<details><summary>

## 12. Are implants FDA approved?

</summary>

The majority of implants lack FDA approval, but that doesn’t mean efforts aren’t underway to obtain it as is the case for the [VivoKey Spark 2](https://web.archive.org/web/20240930205953/https://dangerousthings.com/product/vivokey-spark/).

</details>

<details><summary>

## 13. What are the risks from a medical perspective?

</summary>

Early animal studies suggested an increased risk of cancerous tumors developing near implants, but the detail most often left out is that cancer was being induced and accelerated in these studies. There's very little real medical risk.

</details>

<details><summary>

## 14. Are there any cases of infection or an allergic reaction?

</summary>

Infection, allergic reaction, or rejection are rare and typically the result of poor aftercare or subpar DIY coatings. 

</details>

<details><summary>

## 15. What about medical imaging?
